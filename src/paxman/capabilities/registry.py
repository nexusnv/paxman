"""Capability registry — versioned lookup of :class:`Capability` instances.

The :class:`CapabilityRegistry` is the **single entry point** the
planner uses to discover capabilities. It is keyed by
``(capability_id, version)`` so the same capability id may be
registered under multiple versions (e.g., ``text_extraction@1.0``
and ``text_extraction@1.1``).

Per ``PACKAGE_STRUCTURE.md`` §2, the registry is the only way to
obtain a capability — subsystems MUST NOT import
``paxman.capabilities.v1.*`` directly.

Public surface
--------------

- :func:`register` — register a :class:`Capability` (process-local).
- :func:`unregister` — remove by ``(id, version)``.
- :func:`get` — look up by ``(id, version)``; raise on miss.
- :func:`get_latest` — look up by id, return the latest version.
- :func:`all_capabilities` — read-only snapshot of all registered.
- :func:`reset` — clear the registry (test-only helper).

Process-local state
-------------------

The registry is **process-local**, matching the contract adapter
registry in :mod:`paxman.contract.registry`. There is no global state
shared across processes; this is intentional.

    Only the V1 capabilities that **self-register on import** are
    re-registered here. The rest (text_extraction,
    regex_extraction, inference, validation) are not part of the
    default registry; they must be registered explicitly by the
    user. This matches the original behaviour: importing
    ``paxman.capabilities.v1`` only registers ``lookup``.

    The V1 lookup module is actively imported via
    :func:`importlib.import_module` (regardless of whether the
    v1 package was previously imported) so the bootstrap is
    self-sufficient. If the import fails (e.g. the v1 package is
    not installed, or has a missing dependency that causes a real
    ImportError), the failure is logged at WARNING level and the
    bootstrap is a no-op — the caller is responsible for
    diagnosing a missing v1 module via the WARNING log.

    .. note::
        **v1.0.2 fix for #64 regression:** the previous implementation
        used ``sys.modules.get("paxman.capabilities.v1.lookup")`` to
        short-circuit, which meant the bootstrap only ran if some
        OTHER code had already imported the v1 module. Before #64
        the reconciler imported ``paxman.capabilities.v1.validation``
        (the layer violation that #64 fixed), which transitively
        loaded the v1 package and triggered ``lookup``'s
        ``_register_on_import`` hook. After #64, no subsystem imports
        from ``paxman.capabilities.v1.*``, so the v1 module is never
        loaded by default — leaving ``lookup`` unregistered and the
        planner producing empty field plans for the goldens.

        The fix: actively import the v1 lookup module via
        :func:`importlib.import_module` so the bootstrap is
        self-sufficient. This restores the implicit-availability
        behavior the bootstrap was designed for, without re-
        introducing the layer violation.
